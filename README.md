## What is stitch?

Traditional REST API architecture is prone to over/underfetching data, and can be difficult to scale.

GraphQL simplifies client-server requests. 

Once the decision has been made to migrate, implementing a GraphQL backend can be complex, tedious and error prone.

This is where Stitch comes into play.  

Stitch is a lightweight graphQL schema generation tool.  You can use stitch to load your RESTful HTTP endpoints and generate GraphQL schemas.
